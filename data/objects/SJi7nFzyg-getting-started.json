If it is not the case, please [install Node.js using this link](https://nodejs.org).\n\n### 1. Install webdesign.io CLI\n-------\nwebdesign.io CLI let you develop websites right on your local machine.\n\nWith the CLI, you can initialize a new site and start workin on it using any text editor. And thanks to webdesign.io built-in web server, you can preview the site with your computer's web browser without even setting up a database.\n\nThe CLI can also deploy sites to any webdesign.io Engine using the `webdesignio deploy` command. Your changes will immediately be reflected on that site without restarting or making any changes to the Engine server app.\n\nTo help you work faster, webdesign.io comes with pre-defined workflows like Pug (former JADE) and it easy to integrate it in your current flow. It also works well with source version control systems like git and svn.\n\n**Install webdesign.io**\n```\nnpm install -g @webdesignio/cli\n```"

Don't forget, everything is open source here.\n\nIf you don't have an account, it will create one for you.\n\n> **NOTE**: Currently the CLI also creates an account for [surge.sh](https://surge.sh/) since this is our current way to upload to AWS S3.\n\n**Launch the webdesign.io server**\n```\nnpm start\n```\n\nOpen your browser at this address [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/), you should see the boilerplate."

Modify the live content of your site!\n--------\n\nGo to your `<< mywebsite>>.webdesignio.com` domain and sign in with the credentials you entered in the CLI.\n\nYou will see the boilerplate page.
